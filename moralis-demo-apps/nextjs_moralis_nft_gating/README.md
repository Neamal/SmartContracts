# Moralis NextJS NFT Gating Demo

[Documentation](http://web.archive.org/web/20221003202135/https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nextjs-nft-gated-website) <!--https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nextjs-nft-gated-website-->

The following assumes that the tutorial at ../nextjs_moralis_auth/  


- First time: 

    Turn the template `.env.local.example` into the appropriate `.evn.local` (or just copy your `.env.local` from `../nextjs_moralis_auth/.env.local/`)

    In this folder run

    ```
    npm install moralis next-auth axios
    npm install wagmi ethers
    ```
- Each time you start the server run

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    and then paste the url [`http://localhost:3000/signin`](http://localhost:3000/    signin) in your browser. For testing, follow the steps outlined at [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20221003202135/https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nextjs-nft-gated-website).

This doesn't seem to work reliably ... it sometimes throws some errors.
