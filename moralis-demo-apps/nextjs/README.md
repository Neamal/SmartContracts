# Moralis NextJS dApp Demo

[Documentation](http://web.archive.org/web/20221101105327/https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nextjs-dapp)

- First time: 

    Turn the template `.env.local.example` into the appropriate `.evn.local` (or just copy your `.env.local` from `../nextjs_moralis_auth/.env.local/`)

    In this folder run

    ```
    npm install moralis next react react-dom ethers
    ```

- Each time you start the server run

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    and then paste the url [`http://localhost:3000/api/balances`](http://localhost:3000/api/balances) in your browser. For testing, follow the steps outlined at [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20221101105327/https://docs.moralis.io/docs/nextjs-dapp).

This doesn't seem to work ...
